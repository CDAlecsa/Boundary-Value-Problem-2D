# Numerical solution generated through a finite difference scheme for the 2D boundary value problem

We compute in Matlab the 2D finite difference scheme with the corresponding boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and source
terms occurring in the right hand side of the homogeneous pressure equation. 
Also, the results are saved in a text file containing the numerical and analytical solution, respectively. 
Optional plots can be un-commented in the Matlab file were the numerical solution is implemented.
