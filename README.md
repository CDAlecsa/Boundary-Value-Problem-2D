# Boundary Value Problem - Poisson equation with nonconstant spatial coefficients - 2D


This a data repository accompanying the paper "Numerical benchmark for flow in highly heterogeneous aquifers"
by Cristian D. Alecsa, Imre Boros, Florian Frank, Peter Knabner, Flavius O. PÄƒtrulescu, Alexander Prechtel,
Andreas Rupp, Nicolae Suciu.

The benchmark is based upon the evaluation of the performance of finite difference numerical method by comparing the numerical solution of the equation for divergence-free flow in porous media with the analytical solutions. The exact solution is constructed by the method of
manufactured solution.

The benchmark contains two-dimensional flow problem with coefficients consisting of realizations of
random space functions log-normally distributed, with exponential correlations.
