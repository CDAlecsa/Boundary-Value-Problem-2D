# An implementation of the finite difference scheme in Maple

We compute in Maple the 2D finite difference scheme with the corresponding boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and source
terms occurring in the right hand side of the homogeneous pressure equation. 
The file contains the construction of the FDM numerical solution in order to observe the structure of the left hand side matrix.
Also, the right hand side of the linear system is presented for a fixed number of discretization elements.
