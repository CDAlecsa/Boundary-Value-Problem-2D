# Numerical coefficients generated in C++ for the 2D problem

In the sub-folder KF (K-field_generators), we create C++ codes in order to generate realizations of random hydraulic conductivity coefficients.
The numerical coefficients are also based upon C++ codes used to compute the numerical coefficients of the analytical coefficients.
